        The history of coffee in Japan goes back further than you’d think. When Japan isolated itself from 1638-1858
        (a period called sakoku), foreign merchants’ access to Japan was strictly regulated. On the tiny island of
        Dejima, in Nagasaki, European merchants drank coffee, though it did not yet catch on among Japanese people.
        <br><br>
        When sakoku ended and gave way to the Meiji restoration, coffee gradually began to be imported, with Tokyo’s
        first coffee shop apparently opening in 1888.

    Tea originated in the region encompassing today's Northeast India, north Myanmar, Southwest China and Tibet, where
    it was used as a medicinal drink by various ethnic groups in the region.[7][8] An early credible record of tea
    drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua Tuo.[9]
    <br><br>
    It was popularised as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East
    Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century.[10] During the
    17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among the English, who started to plant tea on a large scale in India.

    Tea drinking may have begun in the region of Yunnan region, where it was used for medicinal purposes. It is also
    believed that in Sichuan, "people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the
    addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal
    concoction."[8]

    Through the centuries, a variety of techniques for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were
    developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form,[43] while in the Song
    dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular.
    <br><br>
    During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then rolled and dried, a process
    that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green.

    Camellia sinensis is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates.[62] Some varieties
    can also tolerate marine climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England,[63] Perthshire in
    Scotland,[64] Washington in the United States,[65] and Vancouver Island in Canada.[66] In the Southern Hemisphere,
    tea is grown as far south as Hobart in Tasmania[67][68] and Waikato in New Zealand.[69]
